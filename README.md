## Neural Network

### Introduction
This is a TensorFlow neural network framework built on the low-level API for learning purposes.
Ultimately, the goal is to provide a fairly user-friendly way to run and manage neural networks,
similar to my [Theano-based framework](https://github.com/pogrmman/NeuralNet). Because Theano is
no longer actively being developed by a large company, I thought it was best to switch to
TensorFlow.


The reasoning behind building stuff with the low-level API as opposed to the high level one is to
better learn and understand the actual mechanics behind neural networks, and to try out and experiment
with things that aren't implemented in the high-level API
